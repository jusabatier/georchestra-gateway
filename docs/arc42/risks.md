    * High: Major service disruption, security breach, or data loss
    * Medium: Degraded performance, limited functionality, or maintenance challenges
    * Low: Minor inconvenience or easily addressed issues

* **Probability**: The likelihood of the risk materializing
    * High: Likely to occur under normal operating conditions
    * Medium: May occur under certain conditions
    * Low: Unlikely but possible

* **Priority**: Combination of impact and probability
    * Critical: Requires immediate attention
    * High: Should be addressed in the short term
    * Medium: Should be addressed in the medium term
    * Low: Can be addressed opportunistically

## Reliability Risks

### Dependency Availability

**Description**: The Gateway depends on external services (LDAP, OAuth providers, RabbitMQ) that might become unavailable or perform poorly.

**Impact**: High (Authentication failures or service disruption)

**Probability**: Medium

**Priority**: High

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Fallback mechanisms where possible
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Monitoring of dependency health

### Configuration Complexity

**Description**: The Gateway has many configuration options across multiple files, increasing the risk of misconfiguration or conflicting settings.

**Impact**: Medium (Functional issues or security gaps)

**Probability**: High

**Priority**: High

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Configuration validation at startup
- Well-documented configuration examples
- Default secure configurations
- Configuration testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Improper Error Handling

**Description**: Inadequate error handling could lead to cascading failures or information leakage through detailed error messages.

**Impact**: Medium (Service disruption or information disclosure)

**Probability**: Medium

**Priority**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Comprehensive error handling guidelines
- Sanitization of error messages returned to clients
- Detailed internal logging with appropriate level controls
- Regular review of error handling patterns

## Maintenance Risks

### Documentation Currency

**Description**: Documentation might become outdated as the codebase evolves, making it difficult for new developers to understand the system or for administrators to configure it correctly.

**Impact**: Medium (Increased onboarding time, configuration errors)

**Probability**: High

**Priority**: High

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Documentation reviews as part of PR process
- Generated documentation where possible
- Clear ownership of documentation areas
- Regular documentation audits

### Testing Coverage

**Description**: Insufficient test coverage, especially for complex authentication flows or edge cases, could lead to undetected bugs.

**Impact**: Medium (Regressions or unexpected behavior)

**Probability**: Medium

**Priority**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Set minimum test coverage targets
- Focus on critical path testing
- Include edge case testing in QA process
- Integration testing for main authentication flows

### Dependency Management

**Description**: Managing dependencies (Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.) requires regular updates to stay current with security patches and new features.

**Impact**: Medium (Security vulnerabilities or feature gaps)

**Probability**: Medium

**Priority**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Clear process for major version upgrades
